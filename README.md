# Course Management System

This repository showcases the work done by Team CryptoExperts in the Unscript Rookie's Hackathon 2022(Web Domain)

## Problem Statement

We need to make a course managemnt system in this 24hr hackathon which allows teachers to upload course materials that they will be teaching via recorded video lectures and notes. The portal also allows students to examine the courses and purchase them on the website if they choose to pursue them. They can view and begin learning their chosen courses after the purchase is complete. Any doubts, suggestions, or comments from students can be submitted to the course teacher. We were required to create 2 seperate dashboards for teachers and students.

## Services for Students
Students are able to buy up the courses, access the course material and provide the feedback for the particular course that is then shared with the respective teacher.

## Services for Techers
Teachers can register themself on the platform and add the course material that will stored on IPFS blockchain which will allow only the person having CID(content identifier) to download the course and this dashboard entirely runs on CELO network to provide traceability and thus can prevent plagiarism upto a large extent.
